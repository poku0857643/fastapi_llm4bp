- **Security**: Secure data handling and API endpoints.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: The system should handle increased load gracefully.
- **Reliability**: Ensure high availability and minimal downtime.
- **Performance**: Predictions should be returned within acceptable time frames (e.g., <200ms).
- **Compliance**: Adhere to data protection regulations like HIPAA if applicable.

## 3. System Architecture

### Components

- **Data Storage**: Secure storage for training data (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
- **Model Training Pipeline**: Automated pipeline for data preprocessing and model training.
- **Prediction Service**: RESTful API exposing prediction endpoints.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions for automation.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and logging.

```

## 4. Data Requirements

- **Data Sources**: Historical BP readings, patient demographics, medical history.
- **Data Format**: JSON, CSV, or Parquet files.
- **Data Volume**: Support for large datasets (GBs to TBs).
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values.
  - Normalization and scaling.
  - Encoding categorical variables.

## 5. Model Training and Testing

### Model Selection

- Use a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-4) fine-tuned for BP prediction.
- Consider transformer-based architectures for handling sequential data.

### Training Pipeline

- **Data Ingestion**: Automated scripts to fetch and preprocess data.
- **Fine-tuning**: Use frameworks like PyTorch Lightning or TensorFlow.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Automated tuning using libraries like Optuna.
- **Validation**: Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE.

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between components.
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing to ensure API can handle concurrent requests.
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure new changes do not break existing functionality.

## 6. API Design

### Endpoints

- **POST /predict**: Accept input data and return BP prediction.
- **GET /health**: Health check endpoint.
- **GET /metrics**: Expose metrics for monitoring.

### Request and Response Format

- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 or API keys.

### Example Request

```json
{
  "age": 45,
  "gender": "male",
  "medical_history": ["hypertension", "diabetes"],
  "current_medications": ["med1", "med2"],
  "symptoms": ["headache", "dizziness"]
}
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "systolic_bp": 130,
  "diastolic_bp": 85,
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

## 7. Deployment Strategy

- **Containerization**: Use Docker for containerizing the application.
- **Orchestration**: Deploy on Kubernetes for scalability.
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS EKS, Azure AKS, or Google GKE.
- **Load Balancing**: Use services like AWS ELB or NGINX Ingress Controller.
- **Scaling**: Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) based on CPU/memory usage.

## 8. CI/CD Pipeline

### Tools

- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub or GitLab.
- **CI/CD Platform**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD.
- **Artifact Repository**: Docker Hub or Azure Container Registry.

### Pipeline Steps

1. **Code Checkout**: Pull code from the repository.
2. **Code Analysis**: Static code analysis using tools like SonarQube.
3. **Testing**: Run unit and integration tests.
4. **Build**: Build Docker images.
5. **Artifact Storage**: Push images to the repository.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy to staging and then to production after approval.
7. **Monitoring**: Post-deployment health checks.

### Automation

- **Triggers**: On code commit, pull request, or scheduled intervals.
- **Notifications**: Email or Slack notifications for build status.

## 9. Security Considerations
