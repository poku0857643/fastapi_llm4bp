# Specification for LLM-based Blood Pressure Prediction API with Automated Training, Testing, and CI/CD

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the specifications for developing a Blood Pressure (BP) prediction API using a Large Language Model (LLM). The API will be deployed on a scalable platform and will include automated training, testing, and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes.

## 2. Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **Data Ingestion**: Ability to ingest and preprocess raw data for training.
- **Model Training**: Automated training of the LLM on BP prediction data.
- **Prediction API**: Expose endpoints for predicting BP based on input parameters.
- **Testing**: Automated unit, integration, and performance testing.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement CI/CD for seamless integration and deployment.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring and logging of API performance.
- **Security**: Secure data handling and API endpoints.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: The system should handle increased load gracefully.
- **Reliability**: Ensure high availability and minimal downtime.
- **Performance**: Predictions should be returned within acceptable time frames (e.g., <200ms).
- **Compliance**: Adhere to data protection regulations like HIPAA if applicable.

## 3. System Architecture

### Components

- **Data Storage**: Secure storage for training data (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
- **Model Training Pipeline**: Automated pipeline for data preprocessing and model training.
- **Prediction Service**: RESTful API exposing prediction endpoints.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions for automation.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and logging.

```

## 4. Data Requirements

- **Data Sources**: Historical BP readings, patient demographics, medical history.
- **Data Format**: JSON, CSV, or Parquet files.
- **Data Volume**: Support for large datasets (GBs to TBs).
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values.
  - Normalization and scaling.
  - Encoding categorical variables.

## 5. Model Training and Testing

### Model Selection

- Use a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-4) fine-tuned for BP prediction.
- Consider transformer-based architectures for handling sequential data.

### Training Pipeline

- **Data Ingestion**: Automated scripts to fetch and preprocess data.
- **Fine-tuning**: Use frameworks like PyTorch Lightning or TensorFlow.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Automated tuning using libraries like Optuna.
- **Validation**: Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE.

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between components.
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing to ensure API can handle concurrent requests.
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure new changes do not break existing functionality.

## 6. API Design

### Endpoints

- **POST /predict**: Accept input data and return BP prediction.
- **GET /health**: Health check endpoint.
- **GET /metrics**: Expose metrics for monitoring.

### Request and Response Format

- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 or API keys.

### Example Request

```json
{
  "age": 45,
  "gender": "male",
  "medical_history": ["hypertension", "diabetes"],
  "current_medications": ["med1", "med2"],
  "symptoms": ["headache", "dizziness"]
}
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "systolic_bp": 130,
  "diastolic_bp": 85,
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

## 7. Conclusion

This specification provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing a BP prediction API using LLMs, complete with automated training, testing, and CI/CD processes. Adherence to this plan will ensure a scalable, reliable, and secure system that meets both functional and non-functional requirements.
